<h2>Description</h2>

This lab demonstrates how to configure RBAC in Windows Admin Center to restrict user activities.<br />

In Windows Admin Center, RBAC provides limited access to users on the target computers. RBAC in WAC works by configuring every managed server with a PowerShell Just-Enough Administration endpoint. The roles are defined by the endpoint. After connecting a restricted endpoint, a temporary local administrator account is created for managing the machine. If the user is not managing the machine utilizing WAC, the temporary account is automatically deleted.<br />
